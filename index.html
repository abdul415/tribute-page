      <p class="life-header bold">Here's a Time Line of Ratan Tata</p> 
     <ul id="triute-info">
      <li><span class="bold">1868 -</span>29-year-old Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata starts a trading company with a capital of ₹21,000 — the early 
        beginnings of what would one day become the Tata group.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1874 -</span>In a bold move, Jamsetji establishes a textile mill in Nagpur instead of Bombay — India's textile hub. The 
         Empress Mills experiment would prove to be a stroke of genius.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1886 -</span>Empress Mills pioneers employee welfare initiatives, long before they are enacted by law. 150 years later, 
         the Tata group remains a 'people-first' enterprise.</li>

       <li><span class="bold">1904 -</span>It falls to his older son, Sir Dorabji Tata, to bring his father's grand vision for India to life. He

       <li><span class="bold">1907 -</span>Sir Dorab first establishes Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel) in remote Sakchi, and builds a

       <li><span class="bold">1909</span>The Indian Institute of Science is established through the vision of JN Tata, 5 years after his death. The 
         first batch of students is admitted in 1911.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1910 -</span>Jamsetji's dream of bringing clean energy to Mumbai by establishing Western India's first hydro plant, is 
        brought to life by Sir Dorab. Tata Power is born.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1929 -</span>24-year-old JRD Tata receives the first pilot licence in India, the culmination of a childhood fascination 
        with flying and with legendary aviator Louis Bleriot.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">1938 -</span>Sir Nowroji passes away in France, propelling JRD Tata to the most powerful position in the group. At 34, he

        with Tata Sierra, followed by Tata Estate in 1992.</li>

        global leader in network solutions, mobility and IoT.</li>
       <li><span class="bold">2003 -</span>TCS is the first Indian software company to cross one billion dollars in revenues. It goes public in 2004 in
